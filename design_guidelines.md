## Animations & Interactions

**Scroll Behavior**: Smooth scroll with snap-to-section on mobile
**Transitions**: All sections fade-in on scroll into view
**Text Effects**: 
- Typewriter for greeting
- Typing effect for messages
- Glowing text with CSS animations

**Interactive Elements**:
- Balloon pop: Scale to 1.5x then disappear with particle burst
- Button hovers: Gentle scale (1.05x) with shadow increase
- Card interactions: Lift effect (translateY(-4px))

## Responsive Breakpoints
- Mobile: < 768px (single column, stacked sections)
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px (adjusted spacing, larger text)
- Desktop: > 1024px (multi-column grids, enhanced animations)

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy load images in gallery section
- Use CSS animations over JavaScript where possible
- Reduce particle count on mobile devices
- Video quality: lower resolution for mobile networks

## Images Section
No traditional hero image - instead using full-screen video background (bg-video.mp4) throughout the entire page experience. 

**Gallery Placeholders**: Use festive stock images or illustrations:
- Birthday cake with candles (central piece)
- Colorful balloons cluster
- Fireworks display
- Party decorations (streamers, confetti)
- Gift boxes wrapped with ribbons
- Birthday candles close-up

All images should have rounded corners (rounded-xl) and subtle shadow effects.
